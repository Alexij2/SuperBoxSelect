# SuperBoxSelect

SuperBoxSelect is an Advanced 'Listbox' / 'Resource List' custom template
variable for MODX Revolution based on the SuperBoxSelect Ext JS Plugin. The
template variable displays selected items (i.e. resources or other supported
types) as labelled boxes within the form field.

### Requirements

* MODX Revolution 2.6+
* PHP 7.2+

### Features

* Select more than one element (i.e. resource)
* AJAX based list (works fast with a lot of selectable items by pagination)
